# NFEP v0.1.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Project Month:** 1 (Build Systems Enhancement)

## Overview

NFEP v0.1.1 significantly enhances the build system infrastructure with complete integration of all VOL connectors and a robust installation system. This release establishes the foundation for production-ready deployment with comprehensive dependency management and configurable build options.

## 🚀 New Features

### Build System Enhancement (Sprint 1)
- **Complete VOL Connector Integration**: All format connectors (GRIB2, BUFR, GeoTIFF, CDF) now fully integrated into both CMake and Autotools build systems
- **Shared Library Architecture**: Each VOL connector compiles as a separate shared library (.so/.dll) for dynamic loading at runtime
- **Configurable Build Options**: 
  - CMake: `-DENABLE_GRIB2/BUFR/GEOTIFF/CDF=ON/OFF` (default: ON)
  - Autotools: `--enable/disable-grib2/bufr/geotiff/cdf` (default: enabled)
- **Advanced Dependency Detection**: Automatic detection with clear error messages for missing dependencies
- **Isolated Dependency Management**: Each connector manages its own dependencies independently

### Installation System (Sprint 2)
- **Complete Install Targets**: Full installation system implementation for both CMake and Autotools
- **Shared Library Installation**: VOL connector libraries installed to configurable paths
- **CMake Integration**: Generated CMake config files enable `find_package(NFEP)` support
- **Configurable Installation Paths**: 
  - CMake: `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable support
  - Autotools: `--prefix` configure option support
- **Uninstall Support**: Complete uninstall targets in both build systems
- **Platform Support**: Linux/Unix platforms with proper RPATH configuration

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Dependency Management
- **GRIB2**: NCEPLIBS-g2 (NOAA/NCEP libraries) integration
- **BUFR**: NCEPLIBS-bufr (NOAA/NCEP libraries) integration  
- **GeoTIFF**: libgeotiff (OSGeo project) integration
- **CDF**: NASA CDF library integration from https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/latest/cdf39_1-dist-all.tar.gz

### Build Configuration
- **Flexible Configuration**: Enable/disable individual VOL connectors as needed
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Clear messages when dependencies are missing
- **Default Behavior**: All VOL types enabled by default when dependencies are available
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Enhanced support across Linux/Unix systems

### Installation Architecture
- **Single Installation Path**: All components install to one configurable location
- **CMake Config Files**: Proper `find_package()` support for downstream projects
- **No Runtime Dependency Verification**: Assumes all required libraries present during installation
- **Standard Directory Structure**: Follows platform conventions for library installation

## 📁 Key Files Modified

### Build System Files
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Enhanced with VOL connector integration and install targets
- `src/CMakeLists.txt` - Updated with shared library configuration
- `Makefile.am` - Autotools integration for all connectors
- `configure.ac` - Enhanced dependency detection and configuration options
- `NFEPConfig.cmake.in` - CMake package configuration template

### Documentation Updates
- `docs/prd.md` - Updated with build system and installation specifications
- `docs/design.md` - Enhanced with shared library architecture details
- `README.md` - Updated build and installation instructions

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### CI/CD Enhancements
- **Build Matrix Testing**: Individual and combined VOL connector configurations
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Testing across multiple Linux distributions
- **Installation Testing**: Comprehensive install/uninstall cycle validation
- **Dependency Testing**: Validation of missing dependency error handling

### Test Configurations
- Individual VOL connector builds (each connector tested independently)
- All VOL connectors enabled together
- Both CMake and Autotools configurations tested in CI
- Installation path configuration testing
