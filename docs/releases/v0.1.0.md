# NFEP v0.1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Project Month:** 1

## Overview

This is the initial release of NFEP (NetCDF4/HDF5 Format Extension Pack), establishing the foundational framework for unified access to diverse NASA Earth Science data formats through standard NetCDF4 and HDF5 APIs.

## 🚀 New Features

### Core Framework
- **NFEP Framework Setup**: Established the core architecture for dynamic connector system
- **Dual Build System**: Implemented both CMake and Autotools build systems for maximum compatibility
- **Connector Architecture**: Created the foundational plugin interface for format-specific connectors
- **Format Detection Engine**: Basic automatic file format identification system

### Initial Format Support
- **Empty GRIB Connector**: Skeleton implementation of GRIB volume connector as foundation for future GRIB2 support
- **BUFR Connector Stub**: Initial BUFR volume connector structure
- **CDF Connector Stub**: Basic CDF volume connector framework

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Test Framework**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated continuous integration testing via GitHub Actions
- **Cross-platform Support**: Build system validation across Linux, Unix, and Windows

## 📁 Key Components Added

- `src/bufr_vol_connector.c` - BUFR format connector implementation
- `src/bufr_vol_connector.h` - BUFR connector header definitions
- `src/cdf_vol_connector.c` - CDF format connector implementation
- `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake build configuration
- `Makefile.am` - Autotools build configuration
- `test/` - Unit testing framework and test cases
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration pipeline

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Build System
- **CMake Support**: Modern CMake configuration for cross-platform builds
- **Autotools Support**: Traditional autotools for legacy system compatibility
- **Dependency Management**: Proper handling of NetCDF4, HDF5, and format-specific libraries

### Architecture
- **Volume Connector Pattern**: Extensible plugin architecture using HDF5 VOL (Virtual Object Layer)
- **Runtime Loading**: Foundation for dynamic connector loading at file open
- **API Compatibility**: Maintains 100% compatibility with existing NetCDF4/HDF5 applications

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests for core framework components
- Build system validation across multiple platforms
- CI pipeline ensuring code quality and compatibility
