# NEP v0.1.6 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 13, 2025

## Overview

This release focuses on comprehensive documentation updates to align with the new versioned release structure and the transition from VOL connectors to User Defined Formats (UDF).

    - v1.0.0: LZ4 Compression
    - v2.0.0: GRIB2 UDF Support (4 sprints)
    - v3.0: CDF UDF Support
    - v4.0: GeoTIFF UDF Support
  - Removed all BUFR references
  - Updated format support from 4 to 3 formats

- **Design Document** (`docs/design.md`)
  - Changed title from "NetCDF/HDF5 Expansion Pack" to "NetCDF Extension Pack"
  - Replaced VOL connector architecture with UDF handler architecture
  - Updated architecture diagram to show UDF Handlers, HDF5 Filters, and Native NetCDF-4
  - Added LZ4 compression as v1.0.0 released feature
  - Updated Current Implementation Status with versioned releases
  - Changed all "VOL connector" terminology to "UDF handler"
  - Updated project structure to reflect current directories
  - Added Release Roadmap section
  - Removed all BUFR references
  - Updated dependency table with version information

- **Roadmap** (`docs/roadmap.md`)
  - Reorganized to show v1.0.0 LZ4 Compression as first major release
  - Moved GRIB2 UDF work to v2.0.0
  - Moved CDF UDF to v3.0
  - Moved GeoTIFF UDF to v4.0
  - Removed BUFR references

## Architecture Changes Reflected in Documentation

### From VOL to UDF
- All documentation now correctly reflects the use of NetCDF User Defined Formats (UDF) instead of HDF5 VOL connectors
- Updated to show nc_def_user_format() registration mechanism
- Emphasized NC_Dispatch interface implementation
- Clarified magic number-based format detection

### LZ4 Compression Emphasis
- LZ4 compression positioned as the v1.0.0 flagship feature
- Technical details added about LZ77 family and performance characteristics
- Clear performance targets: >2x speed improvement over DEFLATE
- HDF5 filter plugin architecture explained

### Format Support Clarification
- Clear versioning for each format:
  - LZ4 Compression: v1.0.0 (Released)
  - GRIB2 UDF: v2.0.0 (In Development)
  - CDF UDF: v3.0 (Planned)
  - GeoTIFF UDF: v4.0 (Planned)
- Use cases added for each format
- BUFR removed from all documentation

## Build System Documentation

- Updated all build examples to remove BUFR options
- Clarified that only GRIB2, GeoTIFF, and CDF UDF handlers are supported
- Added version information to configuration options tables
- Updated dependency tables with library versions and release information

## Breaking Changes

None - this is a documentation-only release.

## Migration Notes

No code changes required. This release only updates documentation to accurately reflect:
1. The current UDF-based architecture
2. LZ4 compression as the v1.0.0 release
3. Planned UDF handler releases (v2.0.0+)
4. Removal of BUFR support
