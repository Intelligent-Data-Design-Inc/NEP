# NEP v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: TBD  
**Focus**: High-Performance Compression with LZ4 and BZIP2

---

## Overview

NEP v1.0.0 marks the first major release of the NetCDF Expansion Pack, delivering high-performance compression for HDF5/NetCDF-4 files with two complementary algorithms: LZ4 (optimized for speed) and BZIP2 (optimized for compression ratio).

---

## New Features

### LZ4 Compression Support

- **High-Performance Compression**: LZ4 compression filter for HDF5/NetCDF-4 files
- **Speed Optimized**: 2-3x faster compression/decompression compared to DEFLATE
- **Lossless Compression**: Guarantees data integrity with no data loss
- **Transparent Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing NetCDF-4 applications through HDF5 plugin system
- **HPC Optimized**: Designed for speed-critical workflows in high-performance computing environments

### BZIP2 Compression Support

- **High-Ratio Compression**: BZIP2 compression filter for HDF5/NetCDF-4 files
- **Compression Optimized**: Better compression ratios than DEFLATE for archival storage
- **Lossless Compression**: Guarantees data integrity with no data loss
- **Block-Sorting Algorithm**: Particularly effective for repetitive scientific data patterns
- **Archival Optimized**: Ideal for long-term storage where compression ratio is prioritized over speed

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- NetCDF-C library (v4.9+)
- HDF5 library (v1.12+)
- LZ4 library
- BZIP2 library
- CMake (v3.9+) or Autotools
- Doxygen (optional, for building documentation)

### Quick Start

**CMake:**
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

**Autotools:**
```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install
```

### Building Documentation Locally

**CMake:**
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON ..
cmake --build . --target docs
# Open build/docs/html/index.html in browser
```

**Autotools:**
```bash
./configure --enable-docs
make docs
# Open docs/html/index.html in browser
```

---

## Performance

### LZ4 Compression Benchmarks

LZ4 compression provides significant performance advantages:

- **Compression Speed**: 2-3x faster than DEFLATE
- **Decompression Speed**: 3-4x faster than DEFLATE
- **Compression Ratio**: Good balance between speed and size reduction
- **Use Case**: Ideal for I/O-bound workflows where speed is critical

---

## Future Roadmap
