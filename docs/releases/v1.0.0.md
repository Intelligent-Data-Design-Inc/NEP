# NEP v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: TBD  
**Focus**: LZ4 Compression and GitHub Pages Documentation

---

## Overview

NEP v1.0.0 marks the first major release of the NetCDF Extension Pack, delivering high-performance LZ4 compression for HDF5/NetCDF-4 files and comprehensive online documentation through GitHub Pages.

---

## New Features

### GitHub Pages Documentation Deployment

- **Automated Documentation Deployment**: Doxygen-generated API documentation automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
- **Public Documentation URL**: https://intelligent-data-design-inc.github.io/NEP/
- **Continuous Updates**: Documentation automatically updates on each release and can be manually triggered
- **Version Management**: Documentation includes version number and build timestamp for tracking
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing CI pipeline
- **Path-Based Triggers**: Documentation rebuilds only when relevant files change (src/, include/, docs/, Doxyfile.in)

### LZ4 Compression Support

- **High-Performance Compression**: LZ4 compression filter for HDF5/NetCDF-4 files
- **Speed Optimized**: 2-3x faster compression/decompression compared to DEFLATE
- **Lossless Compression**: Guarantees data integrity with no data loss
- **Transparent Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing NetCDF-4 applications through HDF5 plugin system
- **HPC Optimized**: Designed for speed-critical workflows in high-performance computing environments

---

## Technical Improvements

### Documentation System

- **Build Date Stamping**: Documentation now includes build timestamp in version information
- **Enhanced Landing Page**: Improved mainpage.md with GitHub repository links and quick navigation
- **Local Build Support**: Complete instructions for building documentation locally with CMake or Autotools
- **Zero-Warning Builds**: Documentation builds enforce zero-warning policy for quality assurance

### Workflow Automation

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: New `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` for automated deployment
- **Multiple Triggers**: Supports manual dispatch, release events, and push-based triggers
- **Verification Steps**: Automated verification of documentation build success
- **Deployment Action**: Uses peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4 for reliable deployment

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- NetCDF-C library (v4.9+)
- HDF5 library (v1.12+)
- LZ4 library
- CMake (v3.9+) or Autotools

### Quick Start

**CMake:**
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

**Autotools:**
```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install
```

### Building Documentation Locally

**CMake:**
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON ..
cmake --build . --target docs
# Open build/docs/html/index.html in browser
```

**Autotools:**
```bash
./configure --enable-docs
make docs
# Open docs/html/index.html in browser
```

---

## Performance

### LZ4 Compression Benchmarks

LZ4 compression provides significant performance advantages:

- **Compression Speed**: 2-3x faster than DEFLATE
- **Decompression Speed**: 3-4x faster than DEFLATE
- **Compression Ratio**: Good balance between speed and size reduction
- **Use Case**: Ideal for I/O-bound workflows where speed is critical
