## Documentation Template

Each example should follow this structure:

```c
/**

 * @brief Basic example demonstrating 2D array creation and reading in NetCDF
 *
 * This example shows the fundamental workflow for working with NetCDF files:
 * - Creating a new NetCDF file
 * - Defining dimensions and variables
 * - Writing data to variables
 * - Closing and reopening the file
 * - Reading and verifying data
 *
 * **Learning Objectives:**
 * - Understand basic NetCDF file structure
 * - Learn dimension and variable definition
 * - Master data writing and reading operations
 * - Implement error handling patterns
 *
 * **Prerequisites:** None - this is a beginner example
 *
 * **Related Examples:**
 * - coord_vars.c - Adds coordinate variables and metadata
 * - f_simple_2D.f90 - Fortran equivalent of this example
 *
 * **Compilation:**
 * @code
 * gcc -o simple_2D simple_2D.c -lnetcdf
 * @endcode
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * @code
 * ./simple_2D
 * ncdump simple_2D.nc

## Success Criteria
- A NetCDF beginner can understand what each example does without reading the code
- Documentation explains NetCDF concepts, not just API calls
- Examples are organized in a logical learning progression
- Cross-references help users navigate between related examples
- Doxygen output includes well-formatted example documentation

## Documentation Principles
- **Assume no prior NetCDF knowledge** - Explain concepts from first principles
- **Focus on concepts, not just syntax** - Explain *why*, not just *how*
- **Use consistent terminology** - Match official NetCDF documentation
- **Provide context** - Explain when and why to use each feature
- **Link liberally** - Connect examples to API docs and related examples
- **Be concise but complete** - Balance brevity with thoroughness

## Related Files
- All C examples: `examples/classic/*.c`, `examples/netcdf-4/*.c`
- All Fortran examples: `examples/f_classic/*.f90`, `examples/f_netcdf-4/*.f90`
- Doxygen config: `docs/Doxyfile.in`
- Examples README: `examples/README.md`
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap.md` v1.5.1 Sprint 4 section

## Notes
- This sprint focuses on documentation quality and accessibility
- Good documentation makes examples valuable learning resources
- Consider the target audience: scientists and engineers new to NetCDF
- Documentation should complement, not duplicate, the code comments
- Examples serve dual purpose: validation tests and educational resources
