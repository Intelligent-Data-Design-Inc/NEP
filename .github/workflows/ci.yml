# GitHub Actions CI workflow for building and testing the project
# This workflow sets up an Ubuntu environment, installs MPI and CMake,
# and runs the build and test commands as specified in the project documentation.
#
# Build command:
#   CC=mpicc cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/ed/Downloads/hdf5-1.14.5
#
# The workflow will also run `make` and `make test`.
#
# NOTE: If /home/ed/Downloads/hdf5-1.14.5 is not available in the CI runner,
# you may need to upload it as an artifact or install HDF5 via apt or another method.
